## Hi there 👋

I like to try building things.

- 🔭 I'm currently working on a perlin noise cli tool in Ada
- 👨‍💻 I'm looking for a 6 month intership in the Paris region

Sometimes I [stream](https://www.twitch.tv/sully_vian) and make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@sully-vian)

## Project ideas

- [ ] Typst library for showing minesweeper
- [ ] Typst procedural terrain generation
- [ ] Tree-gitter: VCS but for AST instead of code (based on tree-sitter)
- [ ] Next.js chatbot webapp
- [ ] TUI chatbot in go (no edit files)
- [ ] Flow-sensitive type qualifying
- [ ] An application that lets you enter how much free time you have and returns a Bible excerpt tailored to that amount of time
- [ ] WikipedAI (purposely slop)
- [ ] Contribute to [La Suite](https://github.com/suitenumerique) (see issues)
- [ ] Implement a @Concept annotation in Java (cf concepts in C++)
- [ ] Implement an @Currify annotation for methods (try reverse arg order in Ocaml
- [ ] Ocaml very strong typing (PF TP6)
- [ ] Play with Shebangs
- [ ] Undercover
- [ ] Chrome extension to highlight code when file opened (see Downloads/)
